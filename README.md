# Predictive Modeling of Healthcare Insurance Charges
# Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis and predictive modeling of healthcare insurance charges. The focus is on forecasting an individual's medical expenses based on various factors such as age, region, number of children, smoking status, and BMI.

# Contents
ML_Case_Study_Insurance_Medical_Charges.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook outlining the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development using Python.
Comprehensive Report on Predictive Modeling of Healthcare Insurance Charges.pdf: A detailed report summarizing the methodology, findings, and insights from the analysis.
Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Steps such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analysis of feature distributions, relationships, and identification of outliers.
Model Development: Implementation of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
Model Evaluation: Comparison of models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
Challenges and Limitations: Insights into the challenges faced during the analysis, including balancing bias and variance, and ensuring model generalizability.
# Installation and Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, Python along with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy are required. Clone the repository and install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
